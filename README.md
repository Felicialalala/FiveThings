# FiveThings
a wardrobe app to remind mw what clothes I have already bought.

So far, only set tops button.

Click on the "tops" button, you can see the tops you have bought. If you just bought a new one, you can click on " Add new item" button, 
the you come to the "addNew" page. You can add the new item's information, including "brand", "the date you bought it", "color", "price" 
and some notes about it.

I haven't fix the camera function, so can't take a picture of it.
